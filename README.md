Code Exercises

- 1. For loop from 100 to 5 by 5. Print index var for each step.
- 2. For loop from 5 to 75 by 10. Print index variable on each value.
- 3. Sum Integers from 9 to 17, print sum of integers
- 4. Find and print the smallest integer in an array a = [9, 5, 6, 3, 8, 2, 4]; and print it.
- 5. Find largest integer in an array a = [9, 5, 6, 3, 8, 2, 4]; and print it.
- 6. Find and print index of first true element in an array of booleans a = [false, false, false, true, false];
- 7. Find and print index of first true element in an array of booleans (must use a while loop) a = [false, false, false, true, false];
- 8. add 5 to every element of an array of integers a = [9, 5, 6, 3, 8, 2, 4]
- 9. divide each element of an array by 1.3; a = [0.5, 1.4, 6.7, 123.4 -34.6]
- 10. raise each element of a double array to it's 3rd power and subtract the original element's value by the value divided by 3.0 a = [1.3, 5.4, 6.1, 1.0, 9.2];
11. zero out a 4 by 6 integer array12. multiply each element of a 5 by 5 array of integers by 7
12. create a method `evenFalse` that takes a 5 by 5 array and produces a 5 by 5 array of booleans. each element in the result should be true if the value in the argument array is even, else it's false.
13. create a method that takes two doubles and returns the first parameter raised to the second parameter's value
14. create a method that returns a boolean if the Object passed to it is a Fish or not
15. There is an object x which has a method (double)Balance(). Build an IF statement that prints "Paid Off" if the result of the balance call is less than of equal to 1.0, else it prints the balance as a Dollar figure (2 decimal places) 
16. Build a WHILE loop that turns on the heat if the thermo.getTemp() is less than 72.0 else it turns on the A/C if thermo.getTemp() is greater that 76.0.
17. Find a number greater than Pi in a double array, print number and its index.
18. Given an array of objects (of class Xaction) w/nulls, sum all the values of the objects in the array, using Xaction::getValue() to get the object's value. Print the sum after the loop.
19. reverse an array of objects of type Xaction
20. Print a 5's times table
21. detemine the hypotenuse of a 9 by 7 right triangle, assign it to a double
